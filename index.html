				Daniel Genath - These 2 words stand for <strong>aviation, sustainability, hiking, and chess</strong>. My northstar values are to be <strong>giving and analytical</strong>. In terms of characteristics, I love to have you-centered communication approach, be a perpetual learner, and <strong>to take ownership</strong>. Currently an HEC student, I did internships in finance, business development, and consulting. My most time consuming project is to be the VP of Sustainability in the newly formed HEC Aviation & Aerospace student club. Feel free to connect! :)

				<h2>Sustainable Aviation</h2>
				<p>
				<strong>Aviation needs to get to zero carbon emissions ASAP.</strong> As a hard-to-decarbonize industry, aviation faces a lot of challenges. Will the new fuel be sustainable kerosene (SAF)? Hydrogen? Will batteries be sufficient? This and more issues I adressed during my work at <strong>Ascendance, H2FLY, and the German Aerospace Center</strong>.

				Also, as the VP of Sustainability of the newly formed HEC Aviation & Aerospace I talk to industry experts and engage fellow students to be sensitive about climate change but still enjoy flying.

				<h2>Hiking and running</h2>
				<p>
				<strong>Standing on the top of the mountain</strong>, knowing that you just climed up 2.000 meters, saw places where other people died, knowing you still have to go back - or <strong>running into the finish line of a marathon</strong>, the last kilometer, knowing you just did it, you achieved this goal that you fought for for so long...

				These are the feelings that I am aiming for in my freetime. I like the phrase work hard, play hard.

				<h2>Chess</h2>
				<p>
				Famous for being the russian national sport, chess is a very anayltical sport. Being able to play for 10 hours straight without a break requires a lot of learnings and engagements. When I was 6, I started playing chess, with the major achievements of playing in the youth german national league in the german team championships in 2012.
